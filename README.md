# Controls
* Camera :
    * cursor - Controls direction camera is pointed at 
    * alt - Toggles cursor control over camera direction
    * w - Move forward
    * s - Move backward
    * a - Move left
    * d - Move right
* Firefly particles:
    * p - Toggle on and off. Toggling off does not kill off particles, so you have to wait for them to die.
* Procedural terrain:
    * r - Procedurally generates a new island
    * l - Loads user-specified terrain from path "terrain/terrain.ppm"
* Shadow Mapping:
    * m - Toggle on and off a side-by-side view of the depth buffer.
